## 🛠️ Code Logic & State Management

The core state is handled cleanly using React hooks in [App.tsx](file:///d:/shlok%20web%20dev/Balrampur-Delivery-App-prototype/customer-store/src/App.tsx):

| State Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cart` | `CartItem[]` | Maintains array of products and active quantities. |
| `selectedLocality` | `string` | Selected delivery zone in Balrampur. |
| `selectedCategory` | `string` | Current category filter (`'all'` or category ID). |
| `selectedShopId` | `string \| null` | Restricts products to an individual shop when active. |
| `searchQuery` | `string` | Search input value filtered against product names and Hindi names. |
| `couponCode` / `appliedDiscount` | `string` / `number` | Active promo coupon and discount deducted from subtotal. |
| `placedOrder` | `OrderDetails \| null` | Contains active order snapshot; toggles confirmation view when non-null. |
